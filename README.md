## Project description:
### **Name**: Face Recognition and Generation
We will create a model for face feature recognition and for face generation with specific parameters.<br>
In this notebook we created the data for this task.<br>
We load the FairFace dataset and its labels and split them into Test, Valid and Train datasets.
<br>
We created a custom dataset for handling the images, and we performed transformations on them.<br>
At the and we created DataLoaders for the datasets and visualized one batch of the train data.
